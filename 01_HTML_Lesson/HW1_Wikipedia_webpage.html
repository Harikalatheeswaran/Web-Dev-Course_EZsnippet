    <h1>The Anonymous (Hacker Group) </h1>
    <h2>Philosophy</h2>
    <p>
        The philosophy of Anonymous offers insight into a long-standing political question that has gone unanswered with often tragic consequences for social movements: 
        <br>what does a new form of collective politics look like that wishes to go beyond the identity of the individual subject in late capitalism?</br>

    <p>
        Because Anonymous has no leadership, no action can be attributed to the membership as a whole. 
        <br>Parmy Olson and others have criticized media coverage that presents the group as well-organized or homogeneous; 
        <br>Olson writes, "There was no single leader pulling the levers, but a few organizational minds that sometimes pooled together to start planning a stunt."
        <br>Some members protest using legal means, while others employ illegal measures such as DDoS attacks and hacking.
        <br>Membership is open to anyone who wishes to state they are a member of the collective;
        <br>British journalist Carole Cadwalladr of The Observer compared the group's decentralized structure to that of al-Qaeda: 
        "If you believe in Anonymous, and call yourself Anonymous, you are Anonymous."
        <br>Olson, who formerly described Anonymous as a "brand", stated in 2012 that she now characterized it as a "movement" rather than a group: 
        "anyone can be part of it. It is a crowd of people, a nebulous crowd of people, working together and doing things together for various purposes."
