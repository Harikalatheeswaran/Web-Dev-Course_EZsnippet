    The Audi R8 is a mid-engine, 2-seater sports car,[2][3] which uses Audi's trademark quattro permanent all-wheel drive system.[2] It was introduced by the German car manufacturer Audi AG in 2006. Production ended in the first quarter of 2024.
    The second generation of the R8 (model code: Type 4S) was unveiled at the 2015 Geneva Motor Show and is based on the Modular Sports System platform shared with the Lamborghini Huracán. The development of the Type 4S commenced in late 2013 and was completed in late 2014 (2015 model year in Europe, 2017 model year in the US). Initial models included the all-electric e-Tron and the V10 5.2 FSI along with the V10 plus. Unlike its predecessor, there was no manual transmission available and the entry-level V8 trim was also dropped.[13][14] In 2016, the convertible (Spyder) variant was added to the line up which was initially available in the base V10 trim. In mid-2017, the high performance V10 plus Spyder was added to the range. A rear-wheel-drive model called the R8 RWS was introduced.

<br>In 2018 (2020 model year in the US), the R8 received<br> a mid-cycle refresh with mechanical and exterior changes. The newer and more aggressive design<br> language carried over from famous Audi models of the past and its appearance is<br> slightly more angular up front. The refreshed model had substantial performance improvements over its<br> predecessor.[15] The base R8 gets a power boost from 532 hp to 562 hp,<br> while the V10 Plus was renamed V10 Performance Quattro and the engine<br> saw a power increase by 10 hp (7 kW), now up to 612 hp.[16] 2023 R8 GT is last R8 with 620 hp limited to 333 units.

The Audi R8 e-tron (2015) was an all-electric version o<br>f the second-generation R8. Unlike the earlier 2010 prototype based on the first-generation R8, it actually entered production, but only on a small scale, with less than 100 units sold. It featured a 92-kWh battery.

Production, available markets and sales
To produce the R8 at Audi Sport GmbH, 70 workers fit 5<br>,000 different parts by hand. The factory at Neckarsulm, redeveloped at a cost of €28 million, usually produces between eight and fifteen cars a day, up to a maximum daily output of 29 cars.[2] Ninety-five lasers inspect the entire car in five seconds to ensure that over 220 measurements are within 0.1 millimetres of the programmed plans.[17]
